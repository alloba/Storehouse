# Storehouse

A tool to gather and keep track of simple data snapshots.

Storehouse provides a simple interface for defining local file archives. 
The intention is to provide a consolidated location for backed up files across multiple directories 
that can provide change-over-time information and the ability to restore snapshots. 

It is intentionally not fancy. 

A successor to the Librarian project. 

**TODO** Usage instructions and overview of data structures will be finalized once a working version is out.
